Happy Thoughts 

This is a small React project where users can write “happy thoughts,” like posts, and see when each message was created.
Users can write a message and post it.
The message appears instantly in a card.

❤️ Like a message

Every card has a like button that switches between a filled and empty heart.
The like count increases or decreases depending on the user's action.

⏱ Timestamp

Each message shows how long ago it was posted (e.g. “20 sec ago”).
